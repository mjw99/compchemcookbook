Restrained mimimisation after adding 4 missing residues
 &cntrl
  imin          = 1,     ! do a minimization
  maxcyc        = 1000,  ! max 1000 minimization steps
  ntmin         = 3,     ! XMIN method is used
  ntb           = 1,     ! periodic boundary conditions
  ntpr          = 1,     ! print every minimization step
  ntwx          = 1,     ! write coordinates each step
  ioutfm        = 1      ! NetCDF MDCRD
  ntr           = 1,     ! Turn on restraints
  restraint_wt  = 20,    ! force constant for restraint
 
  ! We carry out a restrained mimisation with only atoms 
  ! in the region of the just added missing residues 
  ! allowed to move. The solvent is also free to move. 
  ! The missing residues in the original PDB are
  ! 282-285, however, this gets offset (-27) when converted to
  ! a prmtop, hence this range is now 255-258.
  ! We add on 5 residue buffer either side of this range
  ! 
  restraintmask = ":1-249,264-472"     ! restraint mask
                                   !
